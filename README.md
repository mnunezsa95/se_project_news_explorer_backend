### Intro - About the project

The back-end project serves as the backend server for the News Explorer application.

### Description of the Project

The News Explorer back-end component was built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. Node.js serves as backend frame of this News Explorer Application. Express.js was used to create the REST API and MongoDB is used to create a database for storing user information.ES-Lint was used to guide code maintence and ensure code standards are being met.

### Technologies Used

- Express.js : A back end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License.
- Node.js : A cross-platform, open-source server environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more.
- Mongoose : Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. Mongoose supports Node.js.
- REST API : A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style.
- Postman : Postman is an API Platform for developers to design, build, test and iterate their APIs.
- ESLint : ESLint is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code.

### Plans for Improvement

- Add a feature for users to share their bookmarked news articles with other users.
- Introduce features for users to change account information (email, password, name)
- Add a feature for users to add a profile picture or avatar
- Add a sort feature for users to sort articles in different orders (alphabetically, by date, etc)
- Add a search feature for users to have more control over their search parameters (add a starting date / ending date, etc)
- Add testing scripts to the project to allow for futher scaling while maintaing and preserving existing code functionality.

### Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server
`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
